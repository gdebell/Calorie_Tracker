What is Calorie Tracker?

Calorie Tracker is an application developed and designed by Gina DeBell for the Unit 1 Project.  Calorie Tracker will provide the user with calorie and fat information for the food that was entered.

How does it work?

When the user visits the website, he or she can select a pre-determined calorie intake maximum based on gender or can input a number.  After setting a goal, the user is asked what they ate.  The application will provide a drop down menu of items that are in the Nutritionix API that match the users input.  The user can select the food item from the menu.  Calories and fat will be added to the total.  The user can select several items.  The user will receive a message when a calorie maximum has been reached.  The calculate can be reset by refreshing the page.
